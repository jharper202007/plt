# James Harper tech test

## Instructions

- run `npm install` to install any dependencies
- `npm start` will launch the application. It can be accessed in a browser from `localhost:3000`
- `npm test` will run entire test suite
- `npm run test:watch` will run test suite and watch for any file changes

## Notes
- `axios` was used for API calls mostly due to familiarity
- `bootstrap` was used to save time on styling
- I used `redux` for state management since I'm used to using it (and I like redux dev tools a lot), but admittedly it might have been overkill for a smaller project like this
- Some things changed quite significantly during the development. For example, I originally had the filters set up so that multiple filters could be applied at once, but then I realised it wasn't necessary for any of the acceptance criteria - so looking through the commit history should reveal some of these changes.
